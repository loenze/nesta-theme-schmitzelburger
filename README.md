nesta-theme-schmitzelburger
===========================

A theme for [Nesta CMS](http://github.com/gma/nesta).

I wrote this back in Nov '09 while trying out Nesta.
I even set up [a sample page on Heroku](http://schmitzelburger.heroku.com) for it.
Unfortunately I never found the time to put it to good use. Until now I guess.

The header image used on the sample page may not be redistributed, hence I had to remove it from the theme.
The original can be found at [sxc.hu](http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1184005).
A quick replacement has been uploaded as public/schmitzelburger/img/head.png.
I know it's not as beautiful as the old one, but I assume people will replace it anyways.

This design has only been tested on Firefox/Mac, Safari/Mac and my iPhone.
User agent and orientation detection for the latter is included, and
a mobile stylesheet with appropriate changes is loaded automatically.
The according sass file can be found under views/mobile.sass.
